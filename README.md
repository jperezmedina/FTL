# FTL
!FTL, an Articulation-Invariant Stroke Gesture Recognizer with Controllable Position, Scale, and Rotation Invariances

# Overview
FTL is a vector-between-vectors recognition where a gesture is defined by a vector based on geometric algebra and performs recognition by computing a novel Local Shape Distance (LSD) between vectors. !FTL has significant smaller execution time and a lower algorithmic complexity compared to similar algorithms.
